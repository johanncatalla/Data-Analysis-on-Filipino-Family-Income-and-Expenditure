# Data-Analysis-on-Filipino-Family-Income-and-Expenditure
The dataset was sourced through kaggle from the Philippine Statistics Authority's (PSA) Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) nationwide. The survey, which is undertaken every three (3) years, is aimed at providing data on family income and expenditure, including, among others, levels of consumption by item of expenditure, sources of income in cash, and related information affecting income and expenditure levels and patterns in the Philippines.

The Dataset contains more than 40k observations and 60 variables which is primarily comprised of the household income and expenditures of that specific household. For this analysis, I will be using Python's pandas, numpy, and hvplot libraries.
